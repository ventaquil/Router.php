###Decode link:

```php
    Router::decodeLink($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
```
or
```php
    Router::decodeLink('some/link',Router::ROUTER_POST);
```

###Declare view:

```php
    $view=array(
      'basic'=>array(
        'value'=>'\i+',
        'null'=>'\p'
      ), # 'basic'
      'basic/more'=>array(
        'param'=>'\s<10'
      ) # 'basic/more'
    ); # $view
```

###Check link

```php
    if(Router::checkParams($view)){
      // code
    } # if()
```
